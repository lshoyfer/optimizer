I fucked with my friend who was hosting a minecraft server a long time ago... I think junior year of high school...? 
by making this server plugin and telling him it'd "optimize" his server among other (legit) plugins I gave him. What it actually does
is just insert a strangely named command that lets you duplicate items. I didn't actually ruin anything on the server economically or with ill intent
(I didn't play that iteration of his server at the time), I just thought of how funny
it would be for him to stumble into one of the most absurd dupe stashes despite him not having given anymone admin priviledges iirc.
It did happen, and he laughed.
